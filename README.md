# SF2JavaToolSuite
Consolidated project for all of the Java tools

## What is the SF2JavaToolSuite
A collection of Java projects for building .jar applications to be used alongside https://github.com/ShiningForceCentral/SF2DISASM.

## What was wrong with the previous tools?
Nothing was wrong with the tools (.jar apps) - and, in fact, the .jar apps will be added to https://github.com/ShiningForceCentral/SF2DISASM as they always were - but the workflow between so many git repos was becoming unmaintainable.
This change in format allows the tools to be better maintained and improved faster without affecting the Java apps for the SF2DISASM project.
